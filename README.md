## 1. Introduction to Schedula

Schedula is the official course project developed as part of the **Full Stack Development (CS611PE)** course.

Instead of building small, isolated applications, students develop **one complete, real-world full-stack application** throughout the semester.

Schedula is a **web-based salon appointment and booking platform** where:

- Customers can browse salon services and book appointments online  
- Users can manage, reschedule, or cancel their bookings  
- Salon administrators can manage services, time slots, and bookings  
- Appointment conflicts are automatically prevented  
- Access is controlled using roles (Admin / User)

By the end of the semester, students will have:

- A complete MERN-stack application  
- A well-structured GitHub repository  
- Practical experience in building a real-world scheduling system  
- Confidence in explaining a full-stack project during evaluations  

---

## 2. Technologies Used

Through Schedula, students will work with:

- Frontend: React + Material UI / Bootstrap  
- Backend: Node.js + Express  
- Database: MongoDB (Cloud – MongoDB Atlas)  
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)  
- Version Control: Git & GitHub  

This project reflects **industry-standard full-stack development practices** used in real service-based applications.
